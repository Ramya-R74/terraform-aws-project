Terraform AWS Project: Zero to Hero

This project is part of the Terraform Zero to Hero course, where I have developed an end-to-end solution to automate the provisioning of AWS cloud resources using Terraform. The project includes the deployment of a basic Python application on an EC2 instance within a custom VPC, along with the integration of a remote backend for enhanced maintainability and state management.

Features

Automated Resource Provisioning

Amazon EC2: Deploy a virtual machine to run the Python application.

Amazon S3: Create storage buckets for file storage.

Amazon DynamoDB: Manage Terraform lock state for better configuration management.

Custom VPC: Set up a virtual private cloud to isolate and secure resources.

Deployment Automation

Terraform scripts automate the creation, configuration, and deployment of a basic Python application on an EC2 instance.

Remote Backend Integration

Use of a remote backend for storing the Terraform state file, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

Integration with AWS DynamoDB to handle Terraform lock state, ensuring safe and reliable state file management.

Project Architecture

Custom VPC

Subnets (public and private)

Internet Gateway

Route Tables

Compute

EC2 instance for the Python application deployment.

Storage

S3 bucket for file storage.

DynamoDB for Terraform lock state management.

Networking

Security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.

State Management

Remote backend configuration using S3.

Lock state management with DynamoDB.

Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following:

Terraform installed on your local machine.

An AWS account with necessary permissions to provision resources.

AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials.

Getting Started

Clone the Repository

git clone <repository_url>
cd terraform-aws-project

Initialize Terraform

Initialize the Terraform working directory and download the required providers.

terraform init

Plan the Deployment

Review the execution plan before applying changes.

terraform plan

Apply the Configuration

Provision the AWS resources by applying the Terraform scripts.

terraform apply

Destroy the Resources

When no longer needed, destroy the provisioned resources to avoid unnecessary costs.

terraform destroy
